#  Sales Forecasting for Walmart Stores: A Data-Driven Approach
Welcome to our sales forecasting project for Walmart stores! In this project, we dive deep into the world of data analytics to predict weekly sales for various Walmart stores. Our journey unfolds through meticulous data preprocessing, powerful time series analysis, and advanced modeling techniques

##  Acknowledging Dedicated Teammate

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my dedicated teammate for the unwavering commitment and hard work throughout this project. The collaborative efforts, insightful contributions, and diligence have been integral to the project's success. It has been a privilege to work alongside such a talented individual, and I'm excited for the impactful contributions we'll continue to make together in the future.

# Here's an overview of what we've accomplished:

## Project Objective:
Our primary goal is to develop accurate sales forecasts for Walmart stores. These forecasts provide valuable insights for inventory management, resource allocation, and informed decision-making.

###  Key Steps:

### * Data Pre-processing:
Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Explored temporal range, dimensions, columns, and data types.
Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and identified outliers.

### * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed correlations between features and their impact on weekly sales.
Explored store-specific sales trends and holiday effects.

### * Time Series Analysis:
Utilized Auto-ARIMA for automated parameter selection.
Employed SARIMAX models to incorporate exogenous variables.

### * Model Evaluation:
Calculated Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.
Derived insights into model accuracy for individual stores.

### * Inferences and Insights:
Gained insights into forecast accuracy and precision across stores.
Identified opportunities for optimized inventory management and business strategy.

### * Future Directions:
Our project lays the foundation for future enhancements and refinements. We envision:

 * Exploring additional variables for deeper insights.
 * Incorporating machine learning techniques for advanced prediction.
 * Iteratively refining models for even higher accuracy.

We've shared our journey of data-driven exploration and prediction in this GitHub repository. Join us in deciphering sales patterns, harnessing accurate forecasts, and making strategic decisions. Welcome to the world of predictive analytics with Walmart store sales data!
