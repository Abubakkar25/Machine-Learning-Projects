We had built Auto-ARIMA models and SARIMAX models for each stores (45).
We have provided CSV files containing the results of our models. Due to the large size, the pickle files are not uploaded to the repository. 
You can generate your own models using by un-commenting the Auto-ARIMA, SARIMAX codes and export the results to pickle files if needed.
